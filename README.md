# Grav Multi-File-Folder Plugin

The **multifilefolder plugin** for [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) allows 
you to use folders that contain many markdown files, without having to create a subfolder for each page.

# Installation

# Configuration

Only enable option true/false.

## REQUIRES A HACK of 'Pages.php'

Sorry, not smart enough to do it without a hack.

## CACHE
Turn system cache OFF in the system config as you install and try ot out. But, after you have your bugs worked out, Tuen cache on, it works fine for me.

# Why

I have lots of personal sites that use markdown files in a structure of folders with many files in each folder.

I don't want to change the structure, or their filenames just to use GRAV.
